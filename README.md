### Our Project

## Outline & Tasks
- Exploratory data Analysis
- Identification of most interesting variables and relationships
- (possible) feature engineering:
    - log transformations
    - scaling
- Brief description of the models that will be used.
- Fit of models and variables selection.
- Model comparison:
    -AIC, BIC
    - residual Analysis
- Use the best model to actually draw some (possibly) interesting conclusions e.g:
    - which factors contribute the most, by how much...
    - (if applicable) how significant they are.
