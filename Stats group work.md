- Try k-modes clustering/ fix clustering for categorical variables
- add logistic regression:
	- try polynomial regression (age)
	- try interaction terms (cholesterol, active)
	- compare models with AIC/BIC
- compare logistic regression, random forest (and possibly other models: splines?)
- Interpret result where possible:
	- Coefficients in Logistic regression and their significance
	- Variable importance and impurity in random forests
